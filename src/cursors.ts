/**
 * Utilities for working with cursors in a collaborative list
 * or text string.
 *
 * A *cursor* points to a particular spot in a list, in between
 * two list elements (or text characters). This class handles
 * cursors for lists that use our position strings.
 *
 * A cursor is represented as a string.
 * Specifically, it is the position of the element
 * to its left, or `PositionSource.FIRST` if it is at the beginning
 * of the list. If that position is later deleted, the cursor stays the
 * same, but its index shifts to next element on its left.
 *
 * You can use cursor strings as ordinary cursors, selection endpoints,
 * range endpoints for a comment or formatting span, etc.

   * Returns the cursor at `index` within the given list of positions. Invert with `Cursors.toIndex`.

   * That is, the cursor is between the list elements at `index - 1` and `index`.

   * If this method is inconvenient (e.g., the positions are in a database
   * instead of an array), you can instead run the following algorithm yourself:
   * - If `index` is 0, return `PositionSource.FIRST = ""`.
   * - Else return `positions[index - 1]`.
   *
   * @param positions The target list's positions, in lexicographic order.
