# Algorithm

## Background

At a high level, position-strings implements the core of a List CRDT. Each position string corresponds to an element in the list, such that the lexicographic order on strings matches the list order. We don't implement a literal List CRDT with state and operations, but it's straightforward to implement one on top of position-strings.

More specifically, position-strings is based on [Plain Tree: A Basic List CRDT](https://mattweidner.com/2022/10/21/basic-list-crdt.html#a-basic-uniquely-dense-total-order). It is an optimized version of that post's [string implementation](https://mattweidner.com/2022/10/21/basic-list-crdt.html#intro-string-implementation), which uses strings to represent paths in a tree. The strings are designed so that their lexicographic order matches the tree's [in-order traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#In-order,_LNR) order.

## Tree Structure

position-strings's implicit tree is structured in layers. Each layer has a specific type and can only contain nodes of that type. There are 3 layer types that alternate cyclically (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ...). Each position string corresponds to a type-3 node, and the string itself encodes the node labels on the path from the root to that node.

The 3 node/layer types are:

1. **Waypoint nodes**: Labeled by the ID of the `PositionSource` that created it, sorted arbitrarily. The ID ensures that positions created by different `PositionSource`s are distinct: each `PositionSource` only returns positions whose _final_ waypoint node uses its own ID.
2. **valueIndex nodes**: Labeled by an integer, sorted by magnitude. When a `PositionSource` creates positions in a left-to-right sequence, instead of appending a new waypoint node each time, it reuses the first waypoint node and just increases the valueIndex. That causes the position string length to grow logarithmically instead of linearly.
3. **Side nodes**: Labeled by a bit "left side" (0) or "right side" (1). The actual position at a node, and all of the node's right-side descendants, use "right side"; all of its left-side descendants use "left side". This ensures that all left descendants are less than the position at a node, which is less than all right descendants.

### `createBetween`

In terms of the tree structure, `PositionSource.createBetween(left, right)` does the following:

1. If `right` is a descendant of `left`, create a left descendant of `right` as follows. First, create a waypoint node that is a left child of `right` (replacing `right`'s final "right side" bit with "left side"). Then append the next new valueIndex node (usually 0) and a "right side" node, to fill out the 3 layers. Return that final node.
2. Otherwise, see if we can just increase `left`'s final valueIndex, instead of lengthing its path. This is allowed if (a) `left`'s final waypoint node uses our ID, and (b) `right` doesn't use that same waypoint node. If so, look up the next unused valueIndex for that waypoint (stored in `PositionSource`), then use `left` but with that final valueIndex.
3. If not, create a right descendant of `left` like in case 1: append a waypoint node, the next new valueIndex, then "right side"; return that final node.

You can check that the resulting node lies between `left` and `right`, and that this procedure satisfies properties 4-6 from the [README](./README.md).

> The tree we've described so far is similar to that used by the [Logoot List CRDT](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2009.75), which also has alternating layers of IDs and numbers. However, Logoot sorts by numbers first and then IDs, while we do the opposite. This lets us avoid interleaving: if two `PositionSource`s concurrently create a sequence of positions at the same place, their positions will end up under different waypoint nodes, hence appear one after the other.

## String Representation

Finally, we need to map type-3 nodes in the above tree to position strings, such that the tree order matches the position strings' lexicographic order.

Given a tree node `a`, let `aPath` be the sequence of node labels on the path from the root to that node. Note that the tree order matches the "lexicographic order" on these sequences: `a < b` if `aPath[i] < bPath[i]` at the first index `i` where they disagree, or if `aPath` is a strict prefix of `bPath`.

I claim that we can set `a`'s position string to be `aPos = aPath.map(f).join("")` for any `f: (label: string, i: number) => string` with the following property:

- If `aPath` and `bPath` first disagree at index `i` and `aPath[i] < bPath[i]`, then:
  1. `f(aPath[i], i) < f(bPath[i], i)` as strings.
  2. `f(aPath[i], i)` is not a prefix of `f(bPath[i], i)`.

Indeed, then there is some index `j` such that `f(aPath[i], i).charAt(j) < f(bPath[i], i).charAt(j)`. Hence no matter what happens in the rest of `aPos` and `bPos`, we'll still have `aPos < bPos`.

One working `f` is defined as follows, with a different rule for each layer type:

1. (Waypoint nodes) Map the node's label (an ID) to `` `,${ID}.` ``. The period, which is not allowed in IDs, ensures the no-prefix rule (ii).
2. (valueIndex nodes) Map the valueIndex to its _valueSeq_: its entry in a special sequence of numbers that is in lexicographic order and has no prefixes (when base52 encoded). You can read about the sequence we use in the comment above [`position_source.ts`](./src/position_source.ts)'s `nextOddValueSeq` function.
3. (Side nodes) Map "left side" to `"0"` and "right side" to `"1"`.

### Optimizations

In the actual implementation, we optimize the above string representation in a few ways.

First, for waypoint nodes, we only use each "long name" `` `,${ID}.` `` once per position string. If the same ID occurs later in the same path, those nodes get a "short name" that is just an index into the list of prior long names. Index `n` is encoded as `base52(n // 10) + base10(n % 10)`. The set of all waypoint names following a given path is still unique, which ensures rule (i) for some arbitrary order on IDs (not necessarily lexicographic); and they are prefix-free (rule (ii)) due to short names' special ending digit and long names' special starting comma and ending period.

Second, instead of giving each side node a whole character, we give it the last bit in the preceding valueSeq. Specifically, we go by twos in the special sequence, then add 1 if the side is "right".

Third, for the first waypoint node, we use `` `${ID}.` `` (no comma) instead of the long name `` `,${ID}.` ``. Otherwise, every position would start with a redundant `','`.
